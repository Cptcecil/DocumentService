## Document Service Architecture Summary

This project is an ASP.NET Core Web API designed with a clean, modular architecture, utilizing best practices to ensure maintainability, scalability, and testability. The key components of the architecture include:

### 1. **Domain Layer**
   - **Entities**: Core business entities that represent the data model, such as `User`, `Organization`, and `Document`.
   - **Interfaces**: Abstract definitions for repositories and services, allowing for loose coupling and easy testing.

### 2. **Application Layer**
   - **Services**: Contains the business logic of the application. Services interact with repositories to perform operations and implement use cases.
   - **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)**: Define the shape of the data that is sent to and from the API, providing a clean separation between internal models and external-facing data structures.
   - **Audit Logging**: Integrated audit logging service that captures all create and update actions, ensuring traceability and compliance.

### 3. **Infrastructure Layer**
   - **Repositories**: Implementation of data access logic using Entity Framework Core, interacting with the database to perform CRUD operations.
   - **Database Context**: Configuration of the database context using EF Core, supporting both relational databases and in-memory databases for testing.

### 4. **Presentation Layer**
   - **Controllers**: Handle HTTP requests and return responses. Controllers delegate business logic to the services and use DTOs to interact with clients.
   - **Middlewares**: Configurations and middleware components to handle cross-cutting concerns such as authentication, error handling, and logging.

### 6. **Docker and Deployment**
   - **Dockerized**: The project is containerized using Docker, making it easy to deploy in various environments, including cloud platforms like Azure.
